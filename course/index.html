	<h3>Freya was the arrestingly beautiful Norse goddess of blessings, love, and fertility</h3>

	<p><em>Freya is a member of the Vanir tribe known for her skill in divination, she could be both a gentle ruler and a fierce warrior.</em></p>
	<p>Freyja rules over her heavenly field, Fólkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle. The other half go to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. Within Fólkvangr lies her hall, Sessrúmnir. Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful jötnar who wish to make her their wife. Freyja's husband, the god Óðr, is frequently absent. She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names.</p>
