			<em>Gef	</em><br>'the giver'	Gylfaginning, Nafnaþulur
			The name Gefn likely means "she who gives (prosperity or happiness) and is generally considered connected to the goddess name Gefjon, but the etymology of the name Gefjon has been a matter of dispute. The root Gef- in Gef-jon is generally theorized as related to the root Gef- in the name Gef-n." The connection between the two names has resulted in etymological results of Gefjun meaning "the giving one". The names Gefjun and Gefn are both related to the Alagabiae or Ollogabiae, Matron groups.
		Scholar Richard North theorizes that Old English geofon and Old Norse Gefjun and Freyja's name Gefn may all descend from a common origin; gabia a Germanic goddess connected with the sea, whose name means "giving".</p>

			<em>
			Hörn</em><br>	'flaxen'	Gylfaginning, Nafnaþulur
			Appears in the Swedish place names Härnösand, Härnevi and Järnevi, stemming from the reconstructed Old Norse place name *Hörnar-vé (meaning "Hörn's vé"). In addition, the name Hörn also appears as the name of a troll woman in Nafnaþulur.

			<em>
			Mardöll</em><br>
			Potentially 'sea-brightener' by way of mar ('sea') combined with a second element that may be related to Dellingr, indicating light. The name may otherwise mean 'the one who makes the sea swell'.	Gylfaginning, Nafnaþulur	May be connected to the god name Heimdallr.

		<br>
		<p3>
			<em>
			Skjálf	</em><br>
			'shaker'	Nafnaþulur	Also the name of the daughter of a Finnish king in Ynglinga saga. Due to necklace imagery in the Finnish Skjálf's tale (Freyja herself owns Brísingamen) a connection between the two names may exist.

			<em>
			Sýr	</em><br>
			'sow'	Gylfaginning, Skáldskaparmál, Nafnaþulur	The pig was an important symbol of the Vanir and sacrificial practices (blót) associated with the group, particularly in association with Freyja and her brother Freyr.
